  "description": "I’m a Senior Software Engineer in the data group at Drift, a conversational marketing platform that is used for qualifying leads faster, automatically booking meetings and connecting customers to the right business solutions more efficiently. I’ve used Presto quite a bit throughout my career, and I want to first give readers a quick overview of how Presto has enabled my team at Drift to quickly and cost-effectively analyze distributed logs at scale. Then I will share how we used and benefited from Presto at Vistaprint, where I worked previously.",
