  "title": "Querying Nested Data with Lambda Functions",
  "description": "Denormalized data with nested values (e.g. array/map) have become omnipresent in this Big Data era, as a lot of data naturally conforms to a nested representation [1, 2]. As a result it is important to provide an efficient and convenient way to query nested data. SQL traditionally does not include support for this.",
